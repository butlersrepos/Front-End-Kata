# Front-End-Kata

You are looking at Pillar’s very first Front End Kata! We are excited you’ve shown interest in design and interaction as well as an appreciation for presentation layer code!

As an Artisan at Pillar, you will collaborate closely with Experience Designers, Experience Architects, key stakeholders, and product owners to ensure the highest quality experience is being delivered. You’ll be expected to understand a problem in an effort to think critically about a solution that's both correct and future proof.

For this exercise you’ll be laying out a website from scratch and implementing a simple image carousel. You’re free to use whichever technologies or languages you prefer so long as you keep in mind our evaluation criteria below. The screen design can be found in the assets folder along with all images and buttons. While we have provided you with a starting design, if you feel like it may be improved or added to in any way, feel free to do so. We never turn down the opportunity witness creativity in action!

As you tackle the exercise outlined in the this document, please keep in mind the following:

## What we will be evaluating from a technical perspective.
- Does the code written adhere to Pillar’s core quality principles?
- Is the exercise easy to understand, easy to build, and easy to run?
- Are the languages and frameworks used in a functional and idiomatic fashion?
- Can the UI be updated and changed easily?
- Is there an innovative use of technology to enhance the user experience?


## What we will be evaluating from a DX perspective
- Does the webpage reflect the design intent?
- How does the design translate across a variety of screen resolutions i.e. responsive handling from desktop to mobile?
- Have there been any interactions or transitions applied to enhance the user experience?
- What is the overall creative thinking and consistency in flow of experience?

## FAQ
**Can we use Sass, LESS, or some other CSS framework?**
*Yes, we care only that the markup, styles, and code are clean, readable, and get the job done. If a framework helps you achieve that, please use it.*

**How long should I spend on this exercise?**
*Somewhere between 1-3 hours, depending on your speed and familiarity with the domain.*

**I was hoping to design a site from scratch. Can I do that?**
*The intent of this exercise is to blend the realms of DX and Development within a reasonable time frame. While we'd love to see your scratch design skills, we will provide a different exercise sometime in the future for flexing those muscles.*

**Do I need to write tests?**
*Treat it like you any Pillar project; Namely, if you're writing code, configuring tools, or laying out pages that provide business value, they should be tested. We leave it up to your hands to decide the appropriate type and level of testing.*
